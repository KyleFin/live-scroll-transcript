Demo video: https://photos.app.goo.gl/erc5cugnLUC4tfp8A

This project enables Android users to automatically scroll text content in-sync with currently playing audio (For example, listening to an audiobook and having the ebook automatically follow along).

The [Live Caption](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9350862?hl=en) feature provides captions for nearly any audio source. This project provides Live Scroll Transcript, an [accessibility service](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/service) that uses these captions to scroll along in a text source that is currently on-screen.
